# Who-Is-Drunk-and-When-in-Ames-Iowa_
Using data collected from the State of Iowa, we will apply the data wrangling and visualization skills.  We will group, summarize, and visualize data on breath alcohol tests in Ames, Iowa, (home of Iowa State University) from 2013-2017. Some questions we will answer include, 1. "What is the highest recorded value?" and 2. "When do breath alcohol tests occur most?"
